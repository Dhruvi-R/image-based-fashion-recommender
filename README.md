# image-based-fashion-recommender

## Project Description
This project is a fashion recommendation system designed to suggest similar fashion products based on an uploaded image. The system utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract deep visual features from the input image. These features are stored as embeddings in a .pkl file and compared with embeddings of fashion product images from the dataset using similarity measures such as cosine similarity or KNN. Based on this comparison, the system retrieves and recommends the most visually similar fashion items to the user.

## Dataset
For this project, we scraped fresh fashion product images from Ajio to create our dataset, collecting around 850 images across different categories. The scraping was done by extracting product image URLs from the Ajio website and downloading them using Python scripts. We chose to scrape images rather than relying on pre-made datasets because we wanted real, up-to-date fashion products that reflect current market trends. Ajio was selected as the source since it is a popular fashion platform in India, offering a wide variety of clothing and accessories that make the dataset more practical and relevant for building a fashion recommendation system. All the images were stored in a folder and later used to generate feature embeddings with ResNet50, which form the foundation of our similarity-based recommendations.

## What is Resnet50?
ResNet50 is a powerful convolutional neural network introduced by Microsoft Research in 2015 and trained on millions of images from the ImageNet dataset. In our project, we make use of this pre-trained model through transfer learning, where instead of training it from scratch, we simply use it to extract meaningful features from fashion product images. We scraped around 850 images from Ajio and passed them through ResNet50, taking the output from the last convolutional layer before average pooling. This gives us a 2048-dimensional vector for each image, which acts like a unique fingerprint representing its visual characteristics. Collectively, these embeddings form a feature matrix of size 850 × 2048, which we then use to measure similarity between images and recommend products that look visually alike.

## File Structure
•	main.py :Runs the feature extraction pipeline using ResNet50. It loads product images from ajio_images/, extracts embeddings, and saves them into embeddings.pkl.
•	app.py : The recommendation system app (e.g., using Streamlit). Takes an input image, finds similar items using embeddings, and displays recommendations.
•	test.py : A testing/validation script to ensure embeddings and recommendations work correctly (useful for debugging).
•	ajio_images/ : Contains the scraped fashion images from AJIO that are used to train and test the recommender system.
•	embeddings.pkl : Stores precomputed embeddings for all images to speed up similarity search.

## Future Improvements
•	Add text + image multimodal recommendations (brand, description, color).
•	Integrate real-time product fetching from fashion websites.
•	Improve UI/UX with filters (price, category, gender).

## Conclusion
This system provides a simple yet effective way to discover similar fashion products.
By leveraging ResNet50 embeddings and similarity search, it helps users explore new fashion items aligned with their preferences.
