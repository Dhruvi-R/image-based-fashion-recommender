# image-based-fashion-recommender

## Project Description
This project is a fashion recommendation system designed to suggest similar fashion products based on an uploaded image. The system utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract deep visual features from the input image. These features are stored as embeddings in a .pkl file and compared with embeddings of fashion product images from the dataset using similarity measures such as cosine similarity or KNN. Based on this comparison, the system retrieves and recommends the most visually similar fashion items to the user.
